Fun Asian Singles Meetup Business Idea
-	Singles club for Vancouverites interested in East Asian Culture, but not a matchmaking company
-	People sign up to be a member by meeting at the companyâ€™s sponsor branches to answer some diagnostic questions, filling out a form, and paying monthly membership fee
-	Website shows schedule of events; usually there are 5-30 events per month, and at least 1 international traveling event per year; events are subsidized or free for members (given big group discounts)
-	Events try to establish an East Asian theme and include exercise workouts, language classes, video/board/card game tournaments, dining out, sightseeing landmarks throughout the city, dance parties, watching TV shows/movie theatre films, volunteering, traveling etc.
-	Anyone 19 years and older can sign up, and must be able to speak and write in basic English and have an interest in some aspect of East Asian culture
-	Primary communication by members is through MeetUp/Facebook group, although the website/mobile app will include some functionality of communication between member to member and member to staff
